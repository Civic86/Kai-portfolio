            <p className='text-gray-100 bg-[#062438] p-10 mb-20'>In general, the main reasons that people who want to change jobs give up on them are financial and time constraints. The challenge is to find a modern approach to the current situation, recognizing that without time and money, it is difficult to change jobs, open a career, or find a job in the first place. Another challenge identified was that people in other industries who suddenly want to change industries may find it difficult to do so without the knowledge, skills, degrees, and other criteria they needed to meet before they could make the change. That is why we created this application.</p>

            <p className='text-gray-100 bg-[#062438] p-10 mb-20'>To solve the financial and time issues, we came up with and implemented AI-based career suggestions. This allows you to get free and fast career suggestions at any time. In addition, by allowing users to choose in advance which career they would like to pursue, we are able to provide skill-based suggestions specific to their preferences. If there is a skill that is determined to be lacking in a career, the app will suggest Udemy or college courses that will allow the user to catch up on that skill, cost included.</p>
